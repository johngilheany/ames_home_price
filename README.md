# Predicting Home Price (Kaggle Challenge)

**Problem Statement**
- Our firm, General Assembly Advisors (GAA), has been hired by Iowa Landmark Realty (ILR), a real estate development firm looking to expand into Ames. ILR is particularly focused on deciding which neighborhood it should expand into, and has asked us for competitive analysis. The CEO is leaning towards building a new development in Bloomington Heights, and would like to see the final recommendation in relation to that neighborhood. 
- I will visually display data by neighborhood to help the client get better sense of competitive dynamics, and will run regression model to determine the most attractive neighborhoods relative to Bloomington Heights. 

**Data Dictionary**
- I analyzed a data set of 2,000+ property selling prices in Ames between 2007-2010. 
- Full description of x-variables can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dsi-910-ames-housing-challenge/data

**Executive Summary**
- Based on the findings of our proprietary regression model, which we used to determine home price from a variety of predictive variables, one of which was neighborhood, we believe that the 3 neighborhoods you should consider for development are Green Hills, Northridge Heights and Stone Brook. 
- Our modelâ€™s top suggestion is Green Hills, as it was 95% confident that, all else equal, a property in Green Hills will be worth \$74-155k more than a comparable property in Bloomington Heights. 
- However, there were just 2 properties in our data set from Green Hills, so instead our recommend is Stone Brook as it is better represented in our sample, and we are 95% confident that, all else equal, a property in Stone Brook will be worth \\$24-55k\\ more than a comparable property in Bloomington Heights.
